Hi, I'm Helton Bernardo.

## Analyzing the Resonance frequency, leakage energy and effective permittivity

With this open code wrote in python algorithm, we can plot **effective permittivity** effect of the electromagnetic phenomenon in Microstrip Antenna Patches.
Also, we can compute the **resonance frequency** of the any TM<sub>mn</sub>-mode by cavity method using the electromagnetic principles.

I hope that help them.
Thank you.
