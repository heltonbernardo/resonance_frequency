Hi, I'm Helton Bernardo.

## Analyzing the resonance frequency, leakage energy and effective permittivity

With this open code wrote in `notebook jupyter python` algorithm, we can plot **effective permittivity**[^1] effect of the electromagnetic phenomenon in Microstrip Antenna Patches.
It is so usefull for design and analysis of the patches antennas for electromagnetics simulations. 
Also, we can compute the **resonance frequency** of the any TM<sub>mn</sub>-mode by cavity method using the electromagnetic principles.


I hope that help them.
Thank you.
