Hi, I'm Helton Bernardo.

## Analyzing the higher order modes in Microstrip Antenna Patches

With this code we can compute:
- [x] resonance frequency

- [x] Leakage energy (effective extended length)

- [x] And effective relative permittivity

It is an open code wrote in `notebook jupyter python`, which we can plot **effective permittivity**[^1] effect of the electromagnetic phenomenon in Microstrip Antenna Patches.
It is so usefull for design and analysis of the patches antennas for electromagnetics simulations. 
Also, we can compute the **resonance frequency** of the any TM<sub>mn</sub>-mode by cavity method using the electromagnetic principles.


I hope that help them.
Thank you.
